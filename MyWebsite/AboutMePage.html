        <p> Hello! My name is Catherine Livingston. I grew up in Davidson, NC and attended Cannon School lower through upper school.
          In upper school, I was very passionate about science and math. My special interest in physics is what sparked my interest in majoring in mechanical engineering.  
          I was also very passionate about learning Chinese, and I was very lucky to be able to visit China during one summer. After school, I enjoyed dancing and 
          spent every summer studying ballet with different schools across the US. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          After high school, I signed a contract with Boston Ballet for their 2017-2018 season to become a member of Boston Ballet II. I am very grateful for this 
          time to experience life as a professional ballet dancer. 
        </p>
       
        <p>
          Currently, I am a sophomore at Duke University studying computer science and mechanical engineering. 
          I am interested in using my degree to work in software engineering. Outside of academics, I am able to continue dancing 
          in a campus organization called Defining Movement. Defining Movement, more commonly known on campus as DefMo, is Duke's premier
          multicultural dance group that promotes acceptance, unity, and diversity through art.
